## ğŸ§® What is Backtesting??

Backtesting is the process of testing a trading or investment strategy using data from the past to see how it would have performed.
The general idea of a backtest is to run through stock prices in the past, usually with software, and hypothetically firing trades based on a certain trading strategy.

Backtesting accomplishes 3 things:

1. Shows if a strategy performs well in periods when it is supposed to, and vice versa
2. Provides an understanding of how the strategy performs in different markets.
3. Produces insights on how the strategy might be improved on.

## ğŸ’» About this repository:

Backtrader is a Python library that aids in strategy development and testing for traders of the financial markets.
It is an open-source framework that allows for strategy testing on historical data. Further, it can be used to optimize strategies, create visual plots, and can even be used for live trading.

Here I use the Amazon historical prices data, to develop the backtest.
